            <p>   One day in 2015, when I was home from college for a summer visit, I heard mewing from my parents' crawlspace. My mother and I went down to investigate 
               and we found five little kittens, abandoned by their mother and covered in fleas. I crawled on my belly through the dark, dirty cellar to retrieve them. 
               Little Jane was the first one I held. She was only about one day old. My boyfriend at the time, now husband, and I were wanting to get a cat anyway, so 
               we helped bottle raise the litter. Today, Jane is the shyest and smallest of our pets. Named for Jane Eyre, she is tiny, odd, and affectionate. <br>

            <p>   Another cat from the same litter is Charlotte, named for Charlotte Bronte. She and her sister Jane are good friends, we speak of them as an entity, 
               "Charlotte &amp; Jane." Well before I became a parent to a human, I learned that you can raise little beings the same way and they come out with wildly 
               different temperaments. Charlotte could not be more different than her sister Jane. She is extremely outgoing, happily climbing into the lap of any guests
               we have. She is also very affectionate with us. She is the only one of our pets to fully embrace our toddler, allowing him to pet her and snuggling with him 
               during naps. <br>

            <p>My boyfriend and I decided we were ready to get a dog in 2016. We got a tiny chihuahua-dachshund mix puppy and named him Bartleby the Scrivener, from a classic 
               Herman Melleville novella. Bartleby the Scrivener is an extremely stubborn character, and Bartleby the dog is the same way. He has gotten extensive training and 
               we have spent a fortune trying to make this neurotic guy happy and obedient, but he has ultimately taught us to just accept things as they are--he's not changing. 
                He is extremely affectionate and sweet, but also is a constant barker and is not good with other dogs or kids. We love him deeply anyway. <br>

             <p>Herman, named for Herman Mellville to complement Bartleby, was the first pet we got that was unplanned. In late 2016, I went with my friend to PetsMart to help her 
               adopt a cat. She didn't find one she was interested in--but I did! Herman is a big orange tabby who has a very high-pitched voice. He is probably the pet who 
               is the most resistant to change. It is nearly impossible to get him to the vet, and when we moved into our current house, he stayed in the basement with his head 
               pressed against the wall for two full days in protest. As long as he is fed copious amounts of food on a regular schedule, though, he is pretty happy now 
               that he is settled in. <br>

             <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Clyde is another impulsive adoption. My friend worked at the humane society in 2018 and she told me that they had a sweet dachshund up for adoption. When I saw his picture, 
               I couldn't resist. I went to adopt him and he was extremely affectionate from the beginning. He doesn't have a literary name because he came to us with his name. Clyde has had 
              a hard road in life. He was born with swimmer's syndrome, meaning his legs were splayed out. He was given up by his original family. And then, in 2019, he was diagnosed with IVDD, 
              a back condition, and lost the use of his legs until he got emergency back surgery. After this surgery he had 10 weeks of physical therapy in a water treadmill. He whined 
              and cried the whole time! Luckily, he made a full recovery, and now enjoys multiple walks per day with his brother Bartleby. <br>
